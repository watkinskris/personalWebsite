        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong>Leaping Leopards Sewing</strong></em></p>
        <p>I started Leaping Leopards in the summer of 2019.  While looking for leotards for my daughter, I realized just how expensive and ill fitting loetards can be.  I decided that I wanted to offer a more specialized product and fit, at a price that people could afford.  My daughter asked to name the business, and Leaping Leopards Sewing was born.  I focus on producing comfortable and stylish gymnastics leotards and dance wear. </p>
